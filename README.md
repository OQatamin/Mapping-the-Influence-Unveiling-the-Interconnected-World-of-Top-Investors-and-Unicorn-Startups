# Mapping-the-Influence-Unveiling-the-Interconnected-World-of-Top-Investors-and-Unicorn-Startups

"unicorn" is a concept frequently utilized in the venture capital realm, denoting a privately held startup company valued at more than $1 billion. The term gained prominence through the efforts of venture capitalist Aileen Lee, who established Cowboy Ventures, a seed-stage venture capital fund located in Palo Alto, California.

Moreover, "unicorns" can also allude to a trend observed within the human resources (HR) domain. HR professionals may set exceedingly high standards when seeking to fill a position, resulting in a search for candidates possessing qualifications surpassing those strictly necessary for the role. This pursuit of a "unicorn" creates a disjunction between the ideal candidate envisioned by the managers and the feasible hires available within the candidate pool."
